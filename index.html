<h2> The Rhythm of the Road </h2>
<pre><h4>
Have you heard my lullaby
Sung by the streets and its siblings
Honks and horns,
the start of an engine
The occasional squeaky brake.
The theme of the night,
the melody in the morning.
Traffic lights dim in the sunlight
The grammar of anger and frustration
tempered by radio, silence.
Start the day with small victories,
Greens all the way.
The reassuring hustle.
The reaffirming signal.
A new lifestyle, a new day.
